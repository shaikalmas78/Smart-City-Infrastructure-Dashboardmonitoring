# Smart-City-Infrastructure-Dashboardmonitoring
Developed a smart city monitoring system using IoT and AWS (Lambda, S3, SNS) to trigger dynamic traffic signals and alerts based on AQI, noise, and humidity. For temporary use, data is simulated locally using JSON and visualized via a web dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JS.
